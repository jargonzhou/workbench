      "\n",
      "       The new thread terminates in one of the following ways:\n",

      "       * It  calls  pthread_exit(3),  specifying  an exit status value that is\n",
      "         available  to  another  thread  in  the  same  process   that   calls\n",

      "       * It  returns  from  start_routine().   This  is  equivalent to calling\n",

      "\n",
      "       * It is canceled (see pthread_cancel(3)).\n",
      "\n",
      "       * Any of the threads in the process calls exit(3), or the  main  thread\n",
      "         performs  a  return  from main().  This causes the termination of all\n",
      "         threads in the process.\n",
