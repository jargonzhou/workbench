      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "       When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing,\n",
      "       compilation, assembly and linking.  The \"overall options\"\n",
      "       allow you to stop this process at an intermediate stage.\n",
      "       For example, the -c option says not to run the linker.\n",
      "       Then the output consists of object files output by the\n",
      "       assembler.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Other options are passed on to one or more stages of\n",
      "       processing.  Some options control the preprocessor and\n",
      "       others the compiler itself.  Yet other options control\n",
      "       the assembler and linker; most of these are not\n",
      "       documented here, since you rarely need to use any of\n",
      "       them.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Most of the command-line options that you can use with\n",
      "       GCC are useful for C programs; when an option is only\n",
      "       useful with another language (usually C++), the\n",
      "       explanation says so explicitly.  If the description for a\n",
      "       particular option does not mention a source language, you\n",
      "       can use that option with all supported languages.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called\n",
      "       gcc, or machine-gcc when cross-compiling, or\n",
      "       machine-gcc-version to run a specific version of GCC.\n",
      "       When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as\n",
      "       g++ instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The gcc program accepts options and file names as\n",
      "       operands.  Many options have multi-letter names;\n",
      "       therefore multiple single-letter options may not be\n",
      "       grouped: -dv is very different from -d -v.\n",
      "\n",
      "       You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most\n",
      "       part, the order you use doesn't matter.  Order does\n",
      "       matter when you use several options of the same kind; for\n",
      "       example, if you specify -L more than once, the\n",
      "       directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,\n",
      "       the placement of the -l option is significant.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Many options have long names starting with -f or with\n",
      "       -W---for example, -fmove-loop-invariants, -Wformat and so\n",
      "       on.  Most of these have both positive and negative forms;\n",
      "       the negative form of -ffoo is -fno-foo.  This manual\n",
      "       documents only one of these two forms, whichever one is\n",
      "       not the default.\n",
      "\n",
      "       Some options take one or more arguments typically\n",
      "       separated either by a space or by the equals sign (=)\n",
      "       from the option name.  Unless documented otherwise, an\n",
      "       argument can be either numeric or a string.  Numeric\n",
      "       arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal or\n",
      "       hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must begin\n",
      "       with the 0x prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a\n",
      "       size threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large\n",
