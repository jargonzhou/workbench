With Kafka at its core, Confluent offers *complete, fully managed, cloud-native data streaming* that's available everywhere your data and applications reside.\n",
    "- [Quick Start for Confluent Platform](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/platform-quickstart.html#ce-docker-quickstart): In this quick start, you create *Apache Kafka*® topics, use *Kafka Connect* to generate mock data to those topics, and create *ksqlDB* streaming queries on those topics. You then go to *Confluent Control Center* to monitor and analyze the event streaming queries. When you finish, you’ll have a real-time app that consumes and processes data streams by using familiar SQL statements.\n",
