    "\n",
    "ZooKeeper is a high-performance **coordination service for distributed applications**. \n",
    "\n",
    "It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it off-the-shelf to implement *consensus*, *group management*, *leader election*, and *presence* **protocols**. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Our protocol assumes that we can construct **point-to-point FIFO channels between the servers**. While similar services usually assume message delivery that can lose or reorder messages, our assumption of FIFO channels is very practical given that we **use TCP for communication**. Specifically we rely on the following property of TCP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordered delivery : Data is delivered in the same order it is sent and a message m is delivered only after all messages sent before m have been delivered. (The corollary to this is that if message m is lost all messages after m will be lost.)\n",
    "\n",
    "No message after close : Once a FIFO channel is closed, no messages will be received from it."

This means that messages will be `ACK`ed in order and the leader will receive `ACK`s from followers in order, due to the FIFO channels.
