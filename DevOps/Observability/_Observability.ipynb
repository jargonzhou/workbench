    "> In distributed systems, **observability** is the ability to collect data about programs' execution, modules' internal states, and the communication among components. To improve observability, software engineers use a wide range of **logging and tracing techniques** to gather telemetry information, and tools to analyze and use it. Observability is foundational to site reliability engineering, as it is the first step in triaging a service outage.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> One of the goals of observability is to minimize the amount of prior knowledge needed to debug an issue."
