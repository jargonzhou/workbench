    "- **Platform backend** supports data aggregation, analysis and streaming process covers traces, metrics, logs and events. Work as Aggregator Role, Receiver Role or both.\n",
    "- **Storage** houses SkyWalking data through an open/plugable interface. You can choose an existing implementation, such as ElasticSearch, H2, MySQL, TiDB, BanyanDB, or implement your own.\n",
    "- **UI** is a highly customizable web based interface allowing SkyWalking end users to visualize and manage SkyWalking data.\n",
