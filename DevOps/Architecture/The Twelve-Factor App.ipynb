    "[Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/) is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at [FriendFeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed). By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for [long polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling), [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket), and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.\n",

    "\n",
    "Jetty is used in a wide variety of projects and products, both in development and production. Jetty has long been loved by developers due to its long history of being easily embedded in devices, tools, frameworks, application servers, and modern cloud services."
