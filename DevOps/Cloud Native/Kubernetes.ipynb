    "\n",
    "- Pods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "A Deployment provides *declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets*. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ReplicaSet(替代ReplicationController)\n",
    "\n",
    "A ReplicaSet's purpose is to *maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time*. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- StatefulSets\n",
    "\n",
    "StatefulSet is the workload API object used to *manage stateful applications*. Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides *guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods*. Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky **identity** for each of their Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling. If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- DaemonSet\n",
    "\n",
    "A DaemonSet ensures that *all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod*. As nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:\n",
    "\n",
    "running a cluster storage daemon on every node\n",
    "running a logs collection daemon on every node\n",
    "running a node monitoring daemon on every node\n",
    "In a simple case, one DaemonSet, covering all nodes, would be used for each type of daemon. A more complex setup might use multiple DaemonSets for a single type of daemon, but with different flags and/or different memory and cpu requests for different hardware types.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "A Job creates one or more Pods and will *continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate*. As pods successfully complete, the Job tracks the successful completions. When a specified number of successful completions is reached, the task (ie, Job) is complete. Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created. Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple case is to create one Job object in order to reliably run one Pod to completion. The Job object will start a new Pod if the first Pod fails or is deleted (for example due to a node hardware failure or a node reboot).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a Job to run multiple Pods in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run a Job (either a single task, or several in parallel) on a schedule, see CronJob.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic Cleanup for Finished Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "> FEATURE STATE: Kubernetes v1.23 [stable]\n",
    "\n",
    "When your Job has finished, it's useful to keep that Job in the API (and not immediately delete the Job) so that you can tell whether the Job succeeded or failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kubernetes' TTL-after-finished controller provides a TTL (time to live) mechanism to limit the lifetime of Job objects that have finished execution.\n",

    "> FEATURE STATE: Kubernetes v1.21 [stable]\n",
    "\n",
    "A CronJob creates Jobs on a *repeating schedule*.\n",
    "\n",
    "CronJob is meant for performing regular scheduled actions such as backups, report generation, and so on. One CronJob object is like one line of a crontab (cron table) file on a Unix system. It runs a job periodically on a given schedule, written in Cron format.\n",

    "> Note: A Deployment that configures a ReplicaSet is now the recommended way to set up replication.\n",

    "- [About the Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/about/overview/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Open Container Initiative (OCI) \n",
    "> The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a lightweight, open governance structure (project), formed under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. The OCI was launched on June 22nd 2015 by Docker, CoreOS and other leaders in the container industry.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The OCI currently contains three specifications: **the Runtime Specification (runtime-spec)**, **the Image Specification (image-spec)** and **the Distribution Specification (distribution-spec)**. The Runtime Specification outlines how to run a “filesystem bundle” that is unpacked on disk. At a high-level an OCI implementation would download an OCI Image then unpack that image into an OCI Runtime filesystem bundle. At this point the OCI Runtime Bundle would be run by an OCI Runtime.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This entire workflow should support the UX that users have come to expect from container engines like **Docker** and **rkt**: primarily, the ability to run an image with no additional arguments:\n",
    ">\n",
    ">- docker run example.com/org/app:v1.0.0\n",
    ">- rkt run example.com/org/app,version=v1.0.0\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To support this UX the OCI Image Format contains sufficient information to launch the application on the target platform (e.g. command, arguments, environment variables, etc). This specification defines how to create an OCI Image, which will generally be done by a build system, and output an **image manifest**, a **filesystem (layer) serialization**, and an **image configuration**.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Docker is donating its container format and runtime, **runC**, to the OCI to serve as the cornerstone of this new effort. It is available now at https://github.com/opencontainers/runc.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The distribution specification reached v1.0 in May 2020 and was introduced to OCI as an effort to standardize the API to distribute container images. However, the specification is designed generically enough to be leveraged as a distribution mechanism for any type of content.\n",
